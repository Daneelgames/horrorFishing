  epigraphs:
  - 'He was winning hide and seek every time. But once luck turned up for me and
    I finally found him. Was it luck though? '
  - He just knew how to hide anywhere. Sometimes it seemed to me that shadows themselves
    were watching me through his sly eyes.
  - 'Turn off the light, turn it off! I''m tired of living with it, I''m tired of
    seeing it. '
  - They were creating a monument to me in the summaries of history. But it all felt
    just like a simple pain to me.
  - Many years have passed since I've slept for the last time. But I'm already used
    to my eyes clogged with dust.
  - "Every friday we\u2019ve played at our father's work."
